## Purpose
Savage is a high-level Stage 0/1 C2 framework that can handle multiple reverse TCP and HoaxShell-based shells, enhance their functionality with additional features (commands, utilities), and share them among connected sibling servers (Savage instances running on different machines).  

The framework's main features include:
 - Payload generation based on default, customizable and/or user defined payload templates (Windows & Linux),
 - A dynamically engaged pseudo-shell prompt that can quickly swift between shell sessions,
 - File uploads (via http),
 - Fileless execution of scripts against active sessions,
 - Auto-invoke ConPtyShell against a powershell r-shell session as a new process to gain a fully interactive Windows shell,
 - Multiplayer mode,
 - Session Defender (a feature that inspects user issued commands for mistakes / unintentional input that may cause a shell to hang).

|---------------------------------|
| **This project is in active development**. Expect breaking changes with releases. |
| Using this tool against hosts that you do not have explicit permission to test is illegal. You are responsible for any trouble you may cause by using this tool. |

## Installation 

Savage has been explicitly developed and tested on **kali linux**. You can install it with `apt`:
```
apt install Savage
```

‚ùóNew releases may take time to be incorporated into kali's repositories. 

For the latest version or if you prefer to install it manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/BenzoXdev/Savage
cd ./Savage
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You must also install `gnome-terminal` (required for one of the framework's commands):
```
sudo apt update&&sudo apt install gnome-terminal
```

## Usage
You should run as root:
```
Savage [-h] [-p PORT] [-x HOAX_PORT] [-n NETCAT_PORT] [-f FILE_SMUGGLER_PORT] [-i] [-c CERTFILE] [-k KEYFILE] [-u] [-q] 
``` 

:warning: Create your own obfuscated reverse shell templates and replace the default ones in your instance of Savage to better handle AV evasion.

## Contributions
Pull requests are generally welcome. Please, keep in mind: I am constantly working on new tools as well as maintaining several existing ones. I may be slow to respond.
If you have an idea for a new feature that comes with a significant chunk of code, I suggest you first contact me to discuss if there's something similar already in the making, before making a PR.
